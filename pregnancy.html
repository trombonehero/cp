<h2>Exercise in Pregnancy</h2>
<div class="block">
<p>
Exercise is an important component of staying healthy and comfortable
during pregnancy. As your body experiences the many changes involved,
it can be difficult to find the motivation or energy to take care of
yourself, but determining to do even a little exercise each week can
make a big difference to how you feel - both physically and
emotionally. If you make the effort you will find the benefits to be
well worth it. You may find relief from pain or discomfort, feel more
connected with your body, a better sense of well-being, even an
increase in overall energy! Everybody is different, so the type and
amount of exercise you do should be particular to your needs and
abilities. Talk to your doctor or midwife about what's best for you.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Prenatal (or Antenatal) Pilates</h2>
<div class="block">
<p>
Pilates is often an excellent choice of exercise for before, during
and after pregnancy. With low or no impact, it focusses on
controlled movements strengthening those muscles most involved in
pregnancy and childbirth, and mobilizing joints which can help to relieve
pain and discomfort. Many women experience back pain during pregnancy;
and the stabilizing, strengthening and mobilizing exercises of Pilates
have been shown to be particularly effective in this area.
</p>

<p>
As with most exercise, the sooner you start, the better. Even if you
are only thinking about becoming pregnant at this point, joining a
Pilates class is a great way to begin preparing your body. Also, you
can join any beginner level class at this stage, so your options are
plentiful - but do make sure to tell your instructor as soon as you
know you are pregnant. As you progress in your pregnancy, though, a
regular class will become inappropriate for your body, so finding a
class or instructor that offers Prenatal Pilates would be best.
</p>

<p>
If you are trying Pilates for the first time when you are already
pregnant, you should find a class or instructor that offers Prenatal
Pilates, especially if you are past your first trimester. Make sure to
speak to your doctor before starting any new form of exercise;
your instructor may require your doctor's consent before beginning
your Pilates programme. You may wish to contact your
instructor before booking classes or one-to-ones; this will give you
both the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the options
available to you.
</p>

<p>
As I am currently pregnant myself, I can relate to the many joys and concerns in this exciting time.
Personally I find Pilates invaluable, now more than ever, as it helps me remain confident and connected to my body as I manage the many changes of pregnancy.
I strongly recommend you to take the time to discover if Prenatal Pilates is
right for you.
Feel free to <a href="mailto:info@chrissypilates.com">e-mail me</a> if you have any questions or if you are interested in booking Pregnancy Group Classes or one-to-one Prenatal Pilates sessions.
I wish you a happy, healthy pregnancy!
