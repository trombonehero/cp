		<h2>About Pilates</h2>
		<div class="block">
		<p>
		Pilates is an exercise system which conditions the body, strengthening and balancing the muscles.  A focus on core strength and stability establishes a solid foundation for a healthy, well-balanced body. The Pilates system is designed to build strength and endurance, increase flexibility, improve muscle balance and increase stability, which helps to improve posture and decrease back pain.
		</p>

		<p>
Its inventor, Joseph Pilates, originally called his method "contrology". It focusses the mind as well as the body, teaching us to understand and control the way we move&mdash;or the way we <i>don't</i> move. Pilates is highly modifiable, so it is appropriate for a wide range physical abilities. It may add a finishing touch to an athlete, fill the niche between therapy and exercise after an injury, or give a fresh boost of fitness and energy against daily wear and tear.
		</p>

		<p>
Pilates is unlike any other system of exercise. It makes you think, move and feel things you may not have realised that your body needs.  It's never too early or too late to start; try it for a month and see if you don't feel the difference!

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<div class="block">
		<p>
		My name is Chrissy Anderson. I grew up dancing and have always loved the human body. I believe the human body is the "temple of God" and should be respected, cared for, and enjoyed. 
		</p>

		<p>
		I first discovered Pilates when studying kinesiology in Canada. I was experiencing a great deal of back pain, resulting from a combination of a dance injury and a car accident. I was living through pain and therapy while studying the human body in depth; I found Pilates and fell in love. Therapy left me mobile, but still in pain. Pilates not only made sense, but it made a difference. I have now been pain-free for several years. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Having fallen in the gap between therapy and exercise, having felt my body failing and the temptation to let it go, I know that many of us need what I found. We need to get out of pain or, even better, to prevent it, and to understand and love our bodies better. If I can help one person along that journey, I am content; if I can help many, I am replete. If I can help you, I am delighted.
