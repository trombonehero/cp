		<h2>About Pilates</h2>
		<div class="block">
		<p>
		Pilates is an exercise system which conditions the body, strengthening and balancing the muscles.  A focus on core strength and stability establishes a solid foundation for a healthy, well-balanced body. The Pilates system is designed to build strength and endurance, increase flexibility, improve muscle balance and increase stability, which helps to improve posture and decrease back pain.
		</p>

		<p>
Its inventor, Joseph Pilates, originally called his method "contrology". It focusses the mind as well as the body, teaching us to understand and control the way we move&mdash;or the way we <i>don't</i> move. Pilates is highly modifiable, so it is appropriate for a wide range physical abilities. It may add a finishing touch to an athlete, fill the niche between therapy and exercise after an injury, or give a fresh boost of fitness and energy against daily wear and tear.
		</p>

		<p>
Pilates is unlike any other system of exercise. It makes you think, move and feel things you may not have realised that your body needs.  It's never too early or too late to start; try it for a month and see if you don't feel the difference!
