		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<div class="block">
		<img src="images/headshot.jpeg" align="right"/>
		<p>
		My name is Chrissy Anderson. I grew up dancing and have always loved the human body. I believe the human body is the "temple of God" and should be respected, cared for, and enjoyed.
		</p>

		<p>
		I first discovered Pilates when studying kinesiology in Canada. I was experiencing a great deal of back pain, resulting from a combination of a dance injury and a car accident. I was living through pain and therapy while studying the human body in depth; I found Pilates and fell in love. Therapy left me mobile, but still in pain. Pilates not only made sense, but it made a difference. I have now been pain-free for several years.
		</p>

		<p>
		Having fallen in the gap between therapy and exercise, having felt my body failing and the temptation to let it go, I know that many of us need what I found. We need to get out of pain or, even better, to prevent it, and to understand and love our bodies better. Now, as a STOTT PILATES certified instructor and with nearly 10 years of Pilates experience, my goal is to help others along the journey to a healthy, pain-free lifestyle.
		</p>

		<p>
		Sincerely,<br/>
		~ Chrissy
